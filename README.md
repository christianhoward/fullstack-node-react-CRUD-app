# Quidditch Hooligans Fullstack (MERN)
To learn new technologies, I generally try to replicate an [old project](https://github.com/christianhoward/lab3laravel) from one of my grad school classes and implement it using the Laravel framework instead of vanilla PHP. During my Full-Stack Javascript independent study in Spring 2017, I decided to implement this [same project](https://github.com/christianhoward/Quidditch-Hooligans-JS) using Full-Stack Javascript using jQuery on the front-end and Node/Express on the back-end. This repo is the third iteration of this project, using React/Redux on the front-end and Node/Express on the back-end.

The single page application uses CRUD to create, update, delete, and display Quidditch players from a MongoDB database. Data flow is handled through Redux. This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://infinite-ravine-79700.herokuapp.com/) if you are interested in testing it out.

## Technologies Used
